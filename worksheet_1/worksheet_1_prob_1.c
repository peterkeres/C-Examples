//in c, every program can only have one MAIN!
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    //we use print f to print out too the screen, anything within the " "
    // also if we want the next print to be on another line, we have to use the new line character which is \n
    printf("The title of the book is “C How to Program”.\n");
    // good idea to always return 0, this says the program run was secusseflll
    // any other number would be an error code
