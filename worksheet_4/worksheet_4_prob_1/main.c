#include <stdio.h>

// here we are using a stuct, structs are pretty much creating your own data type in c
// its just like creaing a class in java but you CANT put methods in here!
// there are 2 ways to define a struct, im using the typedef version, this way just saves us from having to use 'struct student varnam' when declaring a type of this class
// the name at the end of the brackets is what the name of this struct/class is, its student
// within the struct, we have 2 pointers to a char that we will use to hold a strings, becuase its holding the address of the first char in the string, we can print out the rest
// from that.
// the last one is a pointer to another type of student, think of this like a linked list
// because the struc has yet to be defined, we have to use 'struct structname' in stead of just 'structname'
typedef struct Student

    //adding values to the fileds in a struct/class is just like it is in java, we use the '.' operator to acces its fields
    //becuase we have a pointer to a string, we can set this field to a whole string and it will put a '\0' at the end for us. it will keep track of the first char in memeory

    aStudent.number = "888888eeeeeee8";
    aStudent.numberInt = 2345;
    
    // here becuase we are using a pointer to set the values, we have to use the '->' operator, its a short hand when using pointer and works just like the '.'
    // if not using the ->, we would have to do like this ' (*stuptr).name ' which is just slighty harder to read
    stuPtr -> name  = "pete";
    stuPtr -> number = "420";

    // when pringint out a string, or a pointer to a char, we can use the %s and it will proint the string for us
