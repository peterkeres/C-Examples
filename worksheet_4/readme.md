# WORKSHEET #4 for C Structures

### Ex. 1. Write a C program according to the following steps:
1.	Define a C struct named Student including a member pointer to the structure itself
2.	Declare a variable aStudent and an array arrStudent (of size 40) of this struct type
3.	Declare a pointer stuPtr to this struct type and initialize it to the address of the variable aStudent 
4.	Write the printf statement to print all the elements of aStudent by using the pointer stuPtr

### Ex. 2. Write a C program according to the following steps:
1.	Define a C struct named Car including a member pointer to the structure itself
2.	Declare a variable aCar and an array arrCar (of size 30) of this struct type
3.	Declare a pointer carPtr to this struct type and initialize it to the address of the variable aCar 
4.	Write the printf statement to print all the elements of aCar by using the pointer carPtr

### Ex. 3. Write a C program according to the following steps:
1.	Define a C struct named Person including a member pointer to the structure itself
2.	Declare a variable aPerson and an array arrPerson (of size 25) of this struct type
3.	Declare a pointer carPtr to this struct type and initialize it to the address of the variable aPerson 
4.	Write the printf statement to print all the elements of aPerson by using the pointer perPtr

### Ex. 4. Write a C program according to the following steps:
1.	Define a C struct named Customer including a member pointer to the structure itself
2.	Declare a variable aCustomer and an array arrCustomer (of size 20) of this struct type
3.	Declare a pointer custPtr to this struct type and initialize it to the address of the variable aCustomer 
4.	Write the printf statement to print all the elements of aCustomer by using the pointer custPtr
