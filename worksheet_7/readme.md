You may work on this programming exercise in a group of two students.

### Write a C program using the system call fork(). Your program should totally have 4 processes running, each of which performs a different task listed below:

1.	The root parent process prints its process ID and the integers from 1 to 10 in one line, separated by a comma 
2.	The first child process prints its process ID, its parent process ID, and the integers from 11 to 20 in one line, separated by a comma
3.	The second child process prints its process ID, its parent process ID, and the integers from 21 to 30 in one line, separated by a comma
4.	The third child process prints its process ID, its parent process ID, and the integers from 31 to 40 in one line, separated by a comma.
