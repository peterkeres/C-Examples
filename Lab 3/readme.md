>Lab 3: Selections and Program Looping

### Objective

*Use for, while, and do repetition statements to execute statements repeatedly.*

#### Problem 1:	
A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real estate brokers. Last year, 10 of the students who completed this course took the licensing examination. Naturally, the college wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You have been asked to write a program to summarize the results. You have been given a list of these 10 students. Next to each name a 1 is written if the student passed the exam and a 2 if the student failed.

Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:
   1. Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the prompting message “Enter result” each time the program requests another test result.
   1. Count the number of test results of each type.
   1. Display a summary of the test results indicating the number of students who passed and the number who failed.
   1. If more than eight students passed the exam, print the message “Bonus to instructor!” 


#### Problem 2:
Write a program to generate and display a table that given values of n between 1 and 10, it prints/outputs the values n and n2, for integer values of n ranging from 1 to 10. Be certain to print appropriate column headings. Use while loop.

**Example:**\
n   n^2\
1    1\
2    4\
3    9\
4    16\
5    25\
6    36\
7    49\
8    64\
9    81\
10  100

#### Problem 3:
The factorial of an integer n, written n!, is the product of the consecutive integers
1 through n. For example, 5 factorial is calculated as

    5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Write a program to generate and print a table of the first 10 factorials. Use for loop.

#### Problem 4:
Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of an integer. For example, the sum of the digits of the number 2155 is 2 + 1 + 5 + 5 or 13. The program should accept any arbitrary integer typed in by the user. Use while loop. Hint: How can you use the modulus (%) operator to extract the digit?

#### Problem 5:
Implement a function that computes the approximation of value of π according to the following formula:

    pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ...

Your program must read an integer from the user, and return the approximated value of π. For example, if the user's input is 3, the approximation returned by the function must be given by the calculating the first three terms:

	pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5			 

Use do loop to implement your function. 

#### Problem 6:
Write a program that prints a table of the binary, octal and hexadecimal equivalents of the decimal numbers in the range 1 through 256. Use for loop. 

#### Problem 7:
One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts (sometimes called “histograms”). Write a program that reads five numbers from the user (each between 1 and 20). For each number read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number seven, it should print *******. Use do loop.
