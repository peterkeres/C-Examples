//this code is vald but its doing is not what is intended
// frist off, the name of an array is really a pointer, but it points to the first eleemtn of its array
// by using a %P, we could see the address of this array.
// now , its trying to print an address in the format of a integer
// in order to print out each item in the array, we have to do a loop and go to each eleement and print it
