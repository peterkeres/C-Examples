// when using const on pointers, we have 2 things we can set to constant
// one being the value of what the pinter is pointing too
// two being the value of the addresss of the pointer itself
// when its '* const', it means the value of the pointer (the address it pointed too) can not change
// keep in mind, if you want you can do both!

// this statment is ok becuase it is changing the value of what the pointer is pointint too,
// not the address if what the pointer is pointing too

// this would be ok, if we do the other way we created the pointer, becuase we can change what address
// the pointer is pointing too but not the value stored at that address
